# Multi_armed-Bandit-Algorithms
WEEK 1: Get literature review about the multi-armed bandit, do the exponent latency about the epsilon greedy algorithms
Week 2: Code the optimal rewards and single regret using virtual and real data into epsilon greedy algorothms.
Week 3: Code the Adaptive epsilon greedy algorithms, have a try about UCB
